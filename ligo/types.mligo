        Here we assume that, during all the time since Unix epoch start till
        the moment of tick initialization, i_c was set to âˆž.

        As example, let's say the tick was initialized at 1628440000 timestamp;
        then `seconds_outside` will be initialized with the same timestamp.
        If i_c crossed this tick 5 seconds later, this `seconds_outside` will
        be set respectively to 5.
        If i_c crossed this tick back 3 seconds later, we will get
        `1628440000 + 3 = 1628440003`
        (effectively this will be computed as `cur_time - last seconds_outside =
        1628440008 - 5 = 1628440003`).

        has spent in an any given ticks range.
